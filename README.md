# pdfExtractor
Trying to extract the pdf data using pdf2text inbuilt function available in Ubuntu. 

The pdf is converted to XML and XML parser is used then to convert the data to docx format. 

Complex pdf structure is converted to a normal pdf format that can be used for further processing and analysis.
